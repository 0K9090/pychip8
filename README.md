# pychip8

Another chip8 emulator made in Python.

I made this as sort of a learning project.

It is not completely working yet, there will be some errors.

There is also a weird problem where things like brick breaker and pong don't work (ball doesn't detect collision with the brick or paddle) so I'm gonna fix that soon.
